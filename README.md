## Tech_Essentials_Frontend

This project is a full-stack web application that I built in one day as a challenge to demonstrate my competency in building web applications within a limited amount of time. The stack userd here is MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The user is the admin of an e-commerce website and is allowed to create, read, update and delete data from a MongoDB database. The user can also ciew and edit data in a React front-end. 

Despite it being my first time working with MongoDb and express, I notice that the concepts underlying development are broadly similar. I am proud of this project as it demonstrates my ability to learn new technologies quickly and apply them to build a functional web application.
